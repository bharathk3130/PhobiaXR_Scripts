# PhobiaXR


## Project Overview

A VR-based phobia exposure therapy simulation developed in Unity that integrates live heart rate data from any smartwatch to dynamically adjust environmental intensity based on user stress levels.
The project placed in the Top 5 of the All India XR Creator Hackathon 2024-25. I handled all aspects of the VR and Unity development while also managing the team and coordinating the project.
Note that this only contains the scripts from the project and not the entire project.




## Project Features

1. 3 environments for the 3 different phobias: Claustrophobia, Acrophobia, Nyctophobia
3. Integrated real-time heart rate detection using OpenCV for adaptive exposure therapy
4. Implemented the strategy pattern for elevator behaviour based on stress levels
5. Developed VR mechanics and interactions
6. Created a tutorial system
7. Engineered a modular, extensible audio system
8. Implemented asynchronous scene loading for seamless transitions and improved performance
9. Used GPU instancing to reduce draw calls and improve performance
10. Implemented multiple heart rate input types which the user can seamlessly switch between
11. Utilized Singleton and Observer patterns to ensure a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture
